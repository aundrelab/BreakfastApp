# BreakfastApp
> BreakfastApp is a web application generates random breakfast dishes for the day and links to the real recipes to cook 

For the most of us, we are usually really busy and always eat the same breakfast plate everyday. Most can not think of anything else to make for the day than just cereal. That is why BreakfastApp is here to spice up the day with a ton of different random breakfast dishes to choose from. BreakfastApp generates 3 different breakfast items for the day, a main plate, a side, and a drink. Even if the user does not know how to make any of the dishes that BreakfastApp generates for them, they can find out by clicking on each individual item and they will be redirected to the website that BreakfastApp got the dish from.
